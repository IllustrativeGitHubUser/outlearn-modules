<!-- @section, "title": "Fork the repository" -->

We know you are busy and would rather focus on writing awesome content than setting up directory structures. Never worry, you'll be all set with our path template Github repository. You're first step is to fork this repo. One good strategy to organize content is to keep all your Outlearn content in one repository. The name of the repo does not matter, it could be for example "yourname-outlearn."  If you need a refresher on forking, check out Github's guide on [Forking Projects](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). You can also check out other [Github guides](https://guides.github.com) if you want to brush up on other Github skills.

Once you have forked the repository, open up `outlearn.json` found at the root of the repo. Update the following path metadata fields in the file:

* name (used for the database, must be unique for your account or organization)
* title (shown at the top of path cards)
* description (shown on the path card as additional information)
